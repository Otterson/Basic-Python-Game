# Basic-Python-Game
The basic python game was my introduction project to python game development.

At the beginning the player is represented as a blue block whose position can be changed using the arrow keys. As the game progresses, red blocks will begin falling down the screen at a staggered rate and the objective is to dodge as many blocks as you can. If a collision is detected, you lose. The speed at which these blocks fall gradually increases throughout the game, increasing the difficulty as time progresses.
